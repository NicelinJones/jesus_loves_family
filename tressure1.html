        <h3>Genesis 1:28<br/>
        And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, 
        <br/>and replenish the earth,and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        <br/>and over the fowl of the air,and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. </h3>
        <p> then,why difficulties are coming in humans life
            ?<br/>
        Because of sin, the Man loose their authority to surphant(saitan).
        So To redeem the authority of man, Jesus came to the earth.
        Jesus gave their life to rescue the people from curse.
        Those who believe the jesus,and surrender  his life to jesus, He give them new life.
        Jesus forgive peoples sin.Jesus give the peaceful life to the people.
        some peoples go through self murder because of difficulties.
        Jesus remove their self murder thought and give peaceful life.</p>
